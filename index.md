# i18n & Multilingual SEO Best Practices for AI App Builders
Copy-pasteable guideline prompts for teams building marketing MVPs with **AI app builders** (Lovable, Bubble, Bolt.new, Replit, v0, Floot), **AI-powered IDEs** (Cursor, Windsurf), **coding assistants** (Claude Code) or **AI chatbots** (ChatGPT, Gemini, Claude, Grok, DeepSeek).

## Motivation
Use our **Guiding Rules** to enforce best practices (**SEO**, **i18n**, **multilingual SEO**) with AI app builders to maximize your MVP’s global reach.

Helps:

✅ **No full rewrites** — get builders to follow best practices early

✅ **Self-reviewed code** — ensure changes work before deployment

Avoids:

❌ **Unexpected AI token/credit consumption** when fixing SEO or rolling out multilingual pages

❌ **Endless back-and-forth** testing and fixes whenever you prompt content updates

---

## Who this helps

- Startup teams sprinting a **marketing MVP** with AI-generated code  
- Builders using AI tools to ship fast  
- Devs working in AI-powered IDEs or with assistants who want guardrails  
- Anyone needing practical, production-ready SEO + i18n patterns to maximize global reach

---

## How it works

1. Include best practices in your prompts so AI app builders generate robust code.  
1. The **open-source** guidelines are transparent and free to **tailor** to your specific needs.  
1. Resolve common issues with **conventional prompts** automatically.
